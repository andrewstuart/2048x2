#2048x2
####Multiplayer 2048 at a large scale

This repository is intended to eventually become a multiplayer environment for 2048, where your scores and win records are saved and compared against a global leaderboard.

Hopefully chat rooms could be added as well.  The backend is written in [go](/andrewstuart/2048.go) and uses MySQL for persistence.  Signup will be optional but if you do sign up, you'll get to bring your high scores with you.

I'd also like to include lots of game types, sizes, and numbers of opponents for a little variety.

The front end has been rewritten in angular.js, with the intention og being expandable at the rapid pace angular's flexibility allows.
